# Machine Learning in Business Context - York Univ CSML 1000
####  Turn raw data into value by using CRISP-DM Methodology; suggest possible and plausible Machine Learning (ML) approaches to solve business problems, even with limited information
####  1. Supervised Learning Project: Predict Airline Delays
##### • Business Problem: Using Machine Learning (Binary Classification), predict which flight is likely to be delayed to help airlines plan schedules ahead to avoid bottlenecks at the airports
##### • Dataset: Airline delay dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-adelay)
####  2. Unsupervised Learning Project: Scouting Footballers
##### • Business Problem: Using Machine Learning (Clustering), find the player that meets the specific requirements supplied by a soccer agent
##### • Dataset: FIFA 22 complete player dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-playerdataset/discussion/360882)
####  3. Semi-Supervised Learning Project: Predict Disaster Tweets
##### • Business Problem:Use Natural Language Process (NLP) to identfy emergency response situations from non-emergency situations
##### • Dataset: The dataset is from the Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data)
